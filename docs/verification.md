# Verification record

Date: November 1, 2026 (America/Denver).

## Local checks

- Environment: macOS, Python 3.9.6, standard-library SQLite and unittest.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`: **7 tests passed**.
- README command-line demonstration: **passed**.
- Observed result: The demo published four synthetic records. Failure-injection tests preserved the previous dataset.
- No original applications, production databases, or vendor endpoints were used.

## Repository checks

Fresh Git history and a GitHub no-reply author address are used. Source code, fixtures, documentation, and workflow files were created for this portfolio example. No employer repository was copied or forked.

The tracked-file hygiene checker runs in CI. It checks common credential formats, generated databases, key files, environment files, binaries, and oversized artifacts. It is not a complete secret or ownership audit.

## CI

The workflow runs hygiene checks, tests, and the demo on Python 3.9 and 3.13. GitHub Actions results are the source of truth for remote execution; local results alone do not establish a CI pass.

## Limits

These checks verify the demonstration's behavior, not production readiness, performance, vendor compatibility, or historical business impact. Optional integrations and deployment limitations are stated in the README.
